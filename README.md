Simple-DARTLANG-Examples
====================

Small, simple & independent DART examples for plain beginners; May contain both english and finnish language
Adding slowly more files and features.  Co's this is for SLOW learning...
THE IDEA is to present more properties in every separete ape-level (BUT NOT TOO MUCH!!)
Ape9...  program should be small, but such properties wich were not presented in previous classes...

This is really in very elementary state. I hope someone with better skills had done these, but.. no

ape0_man    extending classes.. simple
ape1_man    extending classes & all 3 classes are instantiated


-----  under construction
ape2_abc + ape2_ape + ape2_hum + ape2_pro       
            Ape got a map... soon will got another.. little cleaning..    
            methods to classes...
            TODO:  humans should make a little broadcasting...
            TODO: FINAL and CONST :s.

----    Planning.. ow.. why is this so slow    -----
ape3_   functions

ape4   control Flow & menus ?

ape5   data-libraries

ape6   ape goes to Facebook (human goes to g+)

ape7   getters & setters, user input...

ape8   ape learns some math...  

evolution      This might be The Goal of these examples.  EVOLUTION
