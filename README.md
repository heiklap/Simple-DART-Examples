Simple-DART-Examples
====================

Small, simple & independent DART examples for plain beginners; May contain both english and finnish language
Adding slowly more files and features.  Co's this is for SLOW learning...
THE IDEA is to present more properties in every separete ape-level (BUT NOT TOO MUCH!!)
Ape9...  program should be small, but such properties wich were not presented in previous classes...

ape0_man    extending classes.. simple
ape1_man    extending classes & all 3 classes are instantiated


-----  under construction
ape2_abc + ape2_ape + ape2_hum + ape2_pro       
            moved classes to separate libraries in different files.     
            methods to classes...
            TODO: ape should have a map...

----    Planning    -----
ape3_   functions

ape4   control Flow & menus ?

ape5   data-libraries

ape6   ape goes to Facebook (human goes to g+)

ape7   getters & setters, user input...

ape8   ape learns some math...
